    "In this lab, we will familiarize ourselves with two python wrappers for the Wikipedia API [wikipedia](https://wikipedia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [wikipedia-api](https://wikipedia-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html). By completing this lab, you should be able to extract information from wikipedia pages and collect page information from larger categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: These are python wrappers for the API, which means that the interactions are much simpler and therefore are limited. \n",
    "Doing more advanced API interactions like [creating a bot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Creating_a_bot#Python) requires use of either the original [Wikimedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) or other specified wrappers. This lab deals primarily with basic extraction of information to get you comfortable with working with APIs\n",
